# FORKED FROM GREAT PROJECT:

## JSON to CSV Converter

A simple JSON to CSV converter that handles objects and nested documents.

Conversion happens inside the browser, in straight JavaScript. It may choke on large files.

Please file all bugs [in the issue tracker](https://github.com/konklone/json/issues).

Read more about the converter and why I built it: "[Making JSON as simple as a spreadsheet](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/03/11/making-json-as-simple-as-a-spreadsheet/)".
